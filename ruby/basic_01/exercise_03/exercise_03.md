### Exercise 3 - Australia is not a dangerous place.

Create a project to get curiosities about a category:

- When I start the project I should see a list of all categories, like:
  - Animals
  - Curiosities
  - Geography
  - History
  - Math   

- Once I choose the category, when I call the method "i_am_curious", then I should see a curiosity about the category chosen.

What I expect:

- I should not see a curiosity from another category.
- I should not see a same curiosity twice.
- When there isn't curiosities, then I should see the message: "That's all folks!"
- Use YAML files to store your curiosities.

Final Challenge:

- Create a method to include curiosities in the YAML file.
