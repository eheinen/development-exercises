##### Formula:
  **BMI = BODY_WEIGHT / (HEIGHT * HEIGHT)**

  BODY_WEIGHT = (kg)   
  HEIGHT = (m)

- Example:

  - Weight: 76kg   
  - Height: 1.72m   
  - BMI: 25,68

  - Classification:   
  - Overweight - Pre-obese

#### Final Challenge:

- If the person has a classification different than **Normal range** then print out how many points this person must lose or win to get the normal range and what is the best body weight to achieve the normal range.

- Example:

  - Weight: 76kg
  - Height: 1.72m
  - BMI: 25,68

  - Points to lose: 0,69
  - Best Weight: 73kg
  - You have to lose 3kg
