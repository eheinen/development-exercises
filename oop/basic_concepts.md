# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc.
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.

## Object

Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.  
For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc.   
It can be physical and logical.

## Class

Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint, or plan, or template, that describes the details of an object.  
A class is the blueprint from which the individual objects are created. Class is composed of three things: A **name**, **attributes**, and **operations**.

## Attributes

Attributes may be defined as characteristics of a class.  
For example:    
Class: **Animal**

Which characteristics an animal has?   
- Type (Kind of the animal)
- Eye color
- Hair color
- Size
- Weight
- Behaviour
- Etc.

## Operations or Methods or Functions

For now, those 3 names are the same thing for us. (There are a little difference between them).

An operator is some instructions passed to a block to do something.
Normally, is an **action** of something.

For example:    
In the same Animal class, let think about which actions an animal can do.

- Eat
- Run
- Change behaviour
- Poop :)
- Search food
- Etc.

In each actions above, we have to describe which **instructions** the operator will follow to achieve its purpose.
